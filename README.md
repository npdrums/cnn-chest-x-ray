## TO DO (to fix the "not learning" problem):

1. Run over preprocessing
2. Data Augmentation
3. Changing learning rate
4. Recalculating batch size
5. Pay attention to your initial loss.
6. Look at individual layers

Suspecting a mistake in preprocessing or with optimizer since various architecures are givin similar results
